Invasion of Poland (1939)
    `<p>German Leader Adolf Hitler understood that his overall conquest of Europe relied on neutralizing
  Poland in the East, gaining a non-aggression assurance from the Soviets and preparing for battle 
  against Britain and France in the West. From there, the final push would be against its one-time
  ally in the Soviet Union giving Hitler's Reich all of the slave manpower, agricultural resources
  and natural resources that it required.

    Adolph Hitler had already devised his plans apart from Britain and French involvement and 
  these were finalized by his commanders on August 26th, 1939. A non-aggression pact had 
  already been signed with the Soviets that same month and the final order to invade was given 
  on August 31st, 1939. On September 1st, 1939, German forces crossed into Polish territory to 
  officially begin World War 2.

    On the brink of war, Hitler's German forces numbered 60 divisions with 2,750 tanks, 2,315 
  aircraft and 9,000 artillery pieces against a Polish force of 39 divisions covering 880 tanks, 
  400 aircraft and 4,300 artillery systems. When the Soviet Union committed to the action, it 
  brought with it 33 divisions numbering 4,736 tanks, 3,300 aircraft and 5,000 field guns of 
  all types. Total manpower committed was 1.5 million German soldiers, 466,500 Red Army troops
  and 51,300 Slovakian soldiers against a smaller Polish threat.

    Against insurmountable odds, the last Polish defenders surrendered on October 6th, ending 
  the German-Soviet campaign against Poland. At the end of the fighting, 66,000 Polish defenders 
  would be killed with a further 133,700 to 200,000 wounded in action. To this was added the 
  humiliation of 694,000 Polish soldiers taken as Prisoners of War (POW) to see certain death 
  through starvation, abuse or execution across the many prison camps and death marches 
  instituted after the invasion. In turn, the German Army managed losses of 16,300 with 30,300 
  wounded in the fighting while the Soviets fared better with 1,475 to 5,300 killed and 2,380 
  wounded in fewer weeks of fighting. Slovakian forces lost 37 with 114 wounded.`
