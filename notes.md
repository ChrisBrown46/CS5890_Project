Ideas:
  - Use mouseover events to highlight and connect battles between the visualizations.
  - Brushing if really ambitious.
  - Encode battles on the timeline and the map: grey->yellow->green
  - Timeline at the top, evenly spaced, not based chronologically
  - Conclusion dot on timeline that shows overall casualities per country/side
